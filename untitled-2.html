                        <p>DESKTOP DICTIONARY is a dictionary I made while in university studying computer science.</p>
                        <p>I took the words and their meanings from the open source Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. From the picture above, you can see that I have referenced the source of the words at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I built the dictionary using JAVA and JAVAFX. I initially built the first version, but it I did not include concurrency and this made it slow. This version, I included multithreading. This made the dictionary very fast and took advantage of the cores in a multicore computer. I also used CSS extensively and worked with java 8's New Input Output (NIO) method. When the dictionary is started, it loads the words and their meanings from a text file into an arrayList. This list is used throughout the use of the dictionary. When a user makes changes to the user interface of the dictionary, this is saved to disc.</p>
                        <h2>Features of the Desktop Dictionary</h2>
                        <p>It performs the function of a dictionary, but not all dictionaries contain antonyms and synonyms. This dictionary contains all that. However it does not contain all the common words used today. From the toolbar in the image below, you can see that I included features such as 'History' button, for viewing search history. Also 'Favorites' button, for viewing your favorite searched words, 'font size' button for making the texts bigger or smaller, etc. The dictionary allows you to search for an exact word, a word that starts/ends with a particular letter or phrase, etc. The 'starred' button is used to save a word to your the favorites's list.</p>

                        <p>The readFavorites() method contains the block of code that takes care of reading the list of favorite words. I commented the source code so there is not much for me to write about here.</p>

                        <p>Font sizes are stored in an array. The important function of writeSettings() method is to save the choice of font size of the user to disc. 'settings.file' stores the settings of the user. When the dictionary is loaded into memory, writeSettings() method is called to read the saved font settings into the application</p>

                        <p>readHistory() method performs one function. It loads the history of searched words from disc. history.txt file stores the history. Each word in this text file occupies one line. So in the source code below, line 564 uses a while loop to iterate through the contents of the history file after its loaded into an inputStream.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>from line 166 of the code below, button backgroundColor is an instance variable of class Dictionary_app_Main. it is declared above the constructor of the class but it is initialized in the constructor. I did that because I wanted the button to be loaded onto the primaryStage of the GUI as soon as the application launches. However, initializing instance variables in a constructor is not recommended, for security reasons. The next time I update this application, I will fix this</p>
