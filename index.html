                    <p class="description">A simple online service I made to help new businesses to select the right price for their product. I asked these business owners about what they were selling and to whom. Then I researched about the products and customers. Finally,

                    <p class="description">During Covid-19 period, most developers were at home. I thought it would be great if we could make friends with like-minded people online. So I built a website for that. The product worked by people introducing themselves on the page.
                        If 2 or more people liked each other's profile, they would then contact themselves directly.&nbsp;</p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>

                    <p class="description">In 2020, a group of final year IT students in a local university, were working on a Travel And Tour project. The aim of their project was to build one platform for visitors to identify site-seing areas in around them. This platform
                        shows visitors all the available hotels, tourist attractions, museums etc available and the directions to the place. I built this project for them.</p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>

                <h3 class="name">a floating clipboard</h3>
                <p class="description">I built this floating clipboard because, you need a simple tool to receive copied variable names and code snippets during programming. Also, a computer's default clipboard does not float and cannot contain more than one item at a time.
                    My clopboard was a desktop application and it solved that problem. I showed to fellow developers on the internet for feedback</p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>

            <p class="description">There was a lot of complaint on ecommerce websites about people ordering the wrong size of clothes and having to ship them back to the manufacturers. I built an online tool to help people to choose the right size of clothes to order. It worked
                by taking the height and weight of the person and recommending a size. The recommended size was based on the reviews of the people who have already bought the same item before and what sizes fit them.&nbsp;</p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>

        <h3 class="name">A Customer Relationship Management System</h3>
        <p class="description">It took me about 2 weeks to built this Customer Relationship Management System (CRM). I used html, css, javascript, php and Mysql to program this online application.&nbsp; This CRM has 3 pages.&nbsp; A page to store information about your potential
            customers, a page for you already acquired customers , and a page for your business plans</p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>

            <p class="description">This was a pet project I made in 2015.&nbsp; It was a small engine that displayed reviews of products.

            <p class="description">For the things you need for only a short time, why don't you rent them from your neighbours or someone in your town?. Do you need a laptop to use for a week, a bicycle to buy some foodstuffs from the market or a grass cutting machine to stop
                the excess growth of your garden grass? Why do need to buy them when you can rent them from your neighbours or people in your town/city and return it when you don't need it anymore?<br><br><br></p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>

                <p class="description">During programming, I used this small tool I made to generate variable names. I coded this tool in java and it reqires you to list all the consonants and vowels in a finite array, then you randomly mix them up. The result of this operation
                    becomes the random word generated.</p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>

                    <p class="description">I made a dictionary for desktop computers. I got the words and meanings from open source word-meaning texts online, then I built a graphical user interface(GUI) around the words. So when a user searches for a word using my GUI, my
                        dictionary searches through the text, retrieves the exact words and return the meaning to the user on my GUI. I programmed it in java and javafx8</p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>

                    <p class="description">I built a translator application using java. It translated from French, Ger man, Italian, Portuge and Spanish to Twi and English; and vice versa. Of course, I can't speak most of these languages, so I took the translations from online

                        <p class="description">During Third year in university, my project mates and I built a pharmacy app for students on campus. You would enter your symptoms and the app would recommend a first aid to you. It would also display the address and phone numbers

                        <p class="description">While living in Sunyani, I built an app to enable people to call taxi drivers in the city. The app worked fine but it failed to become popular. The reason being that, most of the taxi drivers in the city did not use the internet
                            while driving and preferred keeping customers' numbers on their phone rather than on my app</p><a class="action" href="#"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a></div>
