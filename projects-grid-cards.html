                    <div class="text">
                        <p>My School Management System performs 3 functions. 1) It stores students' personal information. 2) During exams, it grades students and prints terminal reports 3) It stores records of fee payment of students and class bills</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h2>Tools I used</h2>
                        <p>I programmed the backend in java. Then I designed Graphical User Interface (GUI) using javafx. I initially programmed everything in intellij Idea community edition, but I later switched to Netbeans IDE. This was because it was
                            easier to import external jar files into Netbeans and I needed those jar files to print terminal report of students. I built this application in 2021. Schools that use this application wanted it in different flavors.&nbsp;
                            For example, the image above is a design for a school whose accountant is also the proprietor. This way, there needs to be only a password for the Accounting - section. But for a school inwhich the proprietor and accountant
                            are sepparate persons, I implemented passwords for Academics - section and Accounting - section.</p>

                        <h2>source code snippet</h2>
                        <p>The picture below is a code snippet of how I developed the School fees part of the Accounting - section. I designed the system from the feedback of numerous accountants in different schools. They expected different systems, but
                            they all had some things in common. As you can see, I used java 8 and applied generics. I also included comments ( in yellow) for every code block.</p>

                        <p>The most demanding part of the Academics - section was making sure the system was right with grade calculations. With the Accounting - section, accurate calculation of financial data was the most time consuming part, as there needed
                            to be no bug in such places</p>
