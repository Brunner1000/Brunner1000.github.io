                        <h2><strong>Features of this software</strong><br></h2>
                        <p>My School Management System performs 3 functions. 1) It stores students' personal information. 2) During exams, it grades students and prints terminal reports 3) It stores records of fee payment of students and class bills.&nbsp;<br>I
                            built this application in 2021. Schools that use this application wanted it in different flavors.&nbsp; For example, the image above is a design for a school whose accountant is also the proprietor. This way, there needs to
                            be only a password for the Accounting - section. But for a school inwhich the proprietor and accountant are sepparate persons, I implemented passwords for Academics - section and Accounting - section.<br><br></p>

                        <h2><strong>Tools I used</strong><br></h2>
                        <p>I programmed the backend in JAVA. Then I designed Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JAVAFX. I initially programmed everything in intellij Idea community edition, but I later switched to Netbeans IDE. This was because it was
                            easier to import external jar files into Netbeans and I needed those jar files to print terminal report of students.&nbsp;<br>The most demanding part of the Academics - section was making sure the system was right with grade
                            calculations. With the Accounting - section, accurate calculation of financial data was the most time consuming part, as there needed to be no bug in such places<br></p>

                        <h2>sample source code of home interface</h2>
                        <p>I comment the code blocks so the source code is self explanatory. On line 52 of the source code, you can see that the interface was built using javafx. The class 'Desktop_main_gui' extends the javafx 'Application' class so that
                            we can implement its default 'start' method. From line 66, I created an instance of 'Borderpane' class, referenced by 'showAppNameOnly'. This borderpane holds all the nodes(items) that you see on the home interface.</p>

                        <p>each button on the screen enables you to access a specific page to perform&nbsp; a specific academic work. Here I will talk about the 'add students', and 'examination'.<br></p>
                        <p>I designed the ACADEMIC SECTION to contain buttons with images. This enhances the User Experience (UX). From the code below, each button contains an image and a text. Then its added to a gridPane. The gridPane is used in javafx
                            to hold items in a particular order.&nbsp;</p>

                            the same time, by importing an excel sheet containing student data<br></p>
                        <p>Line 40 of the source code image below begins the addition of a new student. Method newAdmissionGui() is called to display the fields to enter a new student's details. Finally, when 'save student' button is clicked,&nbsp; method
                            studentIDOperation() on line 70 of the next image is called in the background. This method gives the new student his id, class, subjects and empty terminal report</p>
